JavaScript: History, Purpose, and Web Environment Role

 History of JavaScript
JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while working at Netscape Communications. Initially named "Mocha," it was 
quickly renamed to "LiveScript" and finally to "JavaScript," partly to capitalize on the popularity of Java at the time. 
Despite this, JavaScript is distinct from Java, with different goals and functionalities. JavaScript was standardized by the 
European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) in 1997, leading to the first version of the ECMAScript standard, which JavaScript 
continues to follow today.

 Purpose of JavaScript
JavaScript was initially designed to add interactivity to static web pages, enabling features like form validation, 
animations, and dynamic content updates without needing to reload the page. Over time, JavaScript's capabilities have grown significantly, 
evolving into a powerful language for both client-side and server-side programming. Today, JavaScript powers complex applications and enables 
front-end frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue, making it crucial for modern web development.

 Where JavaScript Runs in the Web Environment
JavaScript is primarily a client-side language, meaning it runs directly in the browser on the user's device,
which allows for quick responses to user actions and reduced server load. However, with the introduction of environments like Node.js
in 2009, JavaScript can also run on the server side, enabling developers to build full-stack applications using a single language.
In the browser, JavaScript operates within the Document Object Model (DOM), allowing it to manipulate HTML and CSS to create interactive,
dynamic web experiences.
